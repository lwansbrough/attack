# Attack

ðŸ§ª This project is to be considered experimental for now. Note it does not have a license.

## Development

To run the development version of the project you only have to run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will instantiate a development server at port 8000 and a watcher together
with hot reloading so changes to files will immediately be reflected in the browser.


## Production

To run this project in production without having the entire source code available,
you first have to run:

```
npm run build
```

The following folders/files will be required to run the production version:
```
 - dist/
 - i18n/
 - public/
 - package-lock.json
 - package.json
 - server.js
```

You can use `npm run prod` to install the node modules and run the production version.
Alternatively you can run `npm install --production` and then `npm run start`.
